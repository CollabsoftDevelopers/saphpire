saphpire
========

Saphpire is a light weight PHP library based on the Juggernaut methodology (created by Dan Bish) and is primarily used with the page controller pattern.  It is designed to overcome the obstacles and limitations created by so called "MVC frameworks."  This library and methodology will speed up the development process without binding you to a specific "framework."
